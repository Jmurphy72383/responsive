                    <p>I am from Alexandria VA and spent most of my early life there. I signed up to join the Marines my senior year of high school and was off to bootcamp 5 days after graduation at the age of 17.  After surviving bootcamp at Parris Island and follow up training, I was deployed all over the world.  During my enlistment I spent time in Okinawa, Thailand, South Korea, Kuwait, and Iraq.  After 4.5 years I left the Marine Corps to seek my next challenge.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I picked up enough IT knowledge during my time in the military to get a job as a Network Administrator at the Pentagon.  Being 22 years old and working in a cubicle wasnt a good combination for me.  I applied for the notorious Blackwater security firm and due to my young age and lack of specialized training, I wasnt hired, but allowed to try out.  This next vetting process had me join 35 other military veterans for a grueling 8 week course.  At the end only 8 of us made it.  I contracted overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan for the next 4 years at a high tempo.  I ended my contracting career as a sub contractor for the CIA in Afghanistan supporting them in their important missions throughout the country.</p>
